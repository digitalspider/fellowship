      <h3>KIDS</h3>
      <p>Creche is available during our serves for all children 3 years or younger. We strive to provide an environment where all parents can enjoy the gospel message, while allowing their children time to play and interact with other children of the church.</p>
      <p>During the Bible message, kids aged 4-9 are encouraged to attend the children's church service downstairs. Children's church is run by volunteer helpers who provide a children's Bible lesson, as well as songs, crafts, games and snacks for the kids. Please inform the helpers if your child has any special needs or dietary requirements.</p>
      <p>Holiday Bible Club is a week-long school-holiday event for children aged 12 and younger. Each year the club is built around a fun theme, and the kids learn interactive Bible lessons while enjoying the skits, music, food, and games – all provided free of charge.</p>
      <h3>FBC YOUTH</h3>
      <p>EPIC is a monthly ministry for students in Junior High (years 7-9). It’s a time when our young people can ask the big question of life, discover Jesus, make friends, and have a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>IGNITE is a bi-weekly ministry for young adults, and includes a regular Bible study, social events, and ministry opportunities to help young people experience the joy of knowing and growing in Christ.</p>
      <h3>SMALL GROUPS</h3>
      <p>Our care groups are all about family doing life together in God’s Word. Each care group meets bi-weekly to enjoy fellowship, Bible study, and prayer. Care groups also plan ministry and social activities together, and are a great way to connect with other members in the church. We have several groups meeting across Western Sydney. We want you to be in a group that works for you.</p>
      <p>Men’s Coffee Club is open to all men and their friends. The men meet every month in a local café for coffee and breakfast. This is primarily a time to catch up, sharpen one another, and enjoy rich, liquid gold.</p>
      <p>FBC Ladies plan monthly events for women, and they range from ministry activities, to baby showers, to mother/daughter occasions. Our ladies hold Bible studies, visit the elderly and sick, and plan fun activities together.</p>
      <h3>EVANGELISM AND MISSIONS</h3>
      <p>Every Saturday we arrange evangelism in the local community. Whether door-knocking or handing out tracts by the train station, this is an opportunity to share the gospel and practice your skills in one-on-one evangelism.</p>
      <p>Evangelistic training takes place every year to help you live out your Christianity. Past courses include, “Share Jesus without Fear,” “Two Ways to Live,” “Good Soil Evangelism,” and “Stand to Reason.”</p>
      <p>The FBC missions committee plans fund-raising events and mission-related activities to raise awareness of our missionaries and their needs.</p>
      <h3>CONFERENCES</h3>
      <p>We promote and attend conferences put on by the Katoomba Christian Convention, an interdenominational organization that hosts annual conferences in the Blue Mountains. Our men attend Basecamp, our women attend One Love, and our kids enjoy Onward. Go to <a href="//www.kcc.org.au">https://www.kcc.org.au</a> for more information on these conferences.</p>
      <p>The AFBC also hosts an annual Bible Conference with international speakers, and the young adult conference Recalibrate.</p>
