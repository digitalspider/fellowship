      <h2>Creche</h2>
      <p>
        Creche is available for all children 3 years or younger. It is located at the back of the kitchen area.
        Creche is a room with books, toys, and space for children to play. It will have at least two supervising volunteers to look after your children.
        You are more than welcome to either stay with your children, or leave them with the supervisors.
        In case of any issues with your children you will be called to assist.<br />
        We strive to provide an environment where all parents can enjoy the gospel message, while allowing their children time to play and interact with other children of the church.

      <h2>Children's Church</h2>
      <p>
        During the service kids of primary school age are encouraged to attend the children's church services, located in a room downstairs.

        During the service there is a time allocated for children to head downstairs. At the end of the service parents are expected to collect their children.
        Please inform the helpers if your child has any special needs, or dietary requirements, before leaving them downstairs.<br />
