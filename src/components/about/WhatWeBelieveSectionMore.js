      <h2>Salvation</h2>
      <p>1. Salvation is wholly of God by grace through faith on the basis of the redemption by Christ Jesus, the merit of His shed blood, and not on the basis of human merit or works; and</p>
      <p>2. Salvation is an all-inclusive term from the special calling of God to justification by faith to regeneration and sanctification through the Holy Spirit to ultimate glorification in the presence of God; and</p>
      <p>3. Believers have two natures, namely the flesh and the spirit; that the believer is to grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ, and to strive to live a life of holiness, characterized by his love of God and the love of his neighbours; and</p>
      <p>4. If the believer is truly regenerated or born again, he has eternal security through the election and grace of God.</p>

      <h2>Satan</h2>
      <p>We believe in the existence of Satan as a supernatural being, the deceiver and prince of this world; that he was defeated and judged by the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore that his final doom is certain.</p>

      <h2>The Church</h2>
      <p>1. All who place their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ are immediately placed by the Holy Spirit into one united spiritual body, the Church, the Bride of Christ, of which He is the Head; and</p>
      <p>2. The formation of the church, the body of Christ, began on the day of Pentecost and will be completed at the coming of Christ for His own at His second coming; and</p>
      <p>3. The establishment and continuity of local churches or assemblies is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament, and that the members of the one spiritual body are directed to associate themselves together in a local church or assembly.</p>
      <p>4. The responsibilities of leaders are to lead or rule as servants and to have Christ's authority in directing the church, the congregation of which are to submit themselves to their leadership; and</p>
      <p>5. The Scriptures stress discipleship within the context of the local church and mutual submission of all believers fellowshipping therein to each other; and</p>
      <p>6. Discipline of sinning members of the local church is to be administered in accordance with the Scriptures; and</p>
      <p>7. The purpose of the Church is to glorify God by the following: <br />
        (a) Building herself up in the faith; and <br />
        (b) Instruction of the Word; and <br />
        (c) Fellowship; and <br />
        (d) Keeping the ordinances of the Church; and <br />
        (e) Advancing and communicating the Gospel to the entire world; and <br />
        (f) Prayer.</p>
      <p>8. The ordinances of the local church which were instituted by Jesus Christ are two in <br />
        number and are as follows: <br />
        (a) Believer's Baptism by immersion; and <br />
        (b) The Lord's Supper, in which all believers in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be invited to participate with due regard to the Scriptural warnings in <em>
        <BibleVerse reference="1CO.11.27-29" text="1 Corinthians 11:27-29" />
      </em>.</p>
      <h2>Separation</h2>
      <p>We believe that the Scriptures require separation to God from the world and from apostasy within the visible church. This doctrine is based upon God's eternal principle of division between truth and error, darkness and light, and His specific command to be separated from unbelievers and disobedient brethren.</p>

      <h2>Last Things</h2>
