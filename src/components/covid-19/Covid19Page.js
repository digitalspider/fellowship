            We are now meeting at our church building on Frederick St as a COVID safe venue.
            The limit on attendees is 62, excluding staff. In order to regulate numbers,
            regular attenders are required to obtain a Sunday pass for each Sunday service they attend.
            Numbers are capped to safely allow extra visitors unfamiliar with our pass system.
            Inside, social distancing is practised, masks and hand sanitiser are available,
            and there is no congregational singing or passing an offering plate.
          </p>

          <p>There is only one Sunday service at 10am, with a childrenâ€™s service running downstairs at the same time</p>
